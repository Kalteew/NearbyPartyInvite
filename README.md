# NearbyPartyInvite

NearbyPartyInvite is a lightweight World of Warcraft addon for Mists of Pandaria Classic that helps you quickly invite players of your faction that you encounter through combat, targeting, or mouseover.

## Installation
Install through [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/nearby-party-invite) using your preferred addon manager. For manual installation, copy the `NearbyPartyInvite` folder into your World of Warcraft `Interface/AddOns` directory and restart the game.

## Usage
- Click the minimap button or type `/npi toggle` to enable or disable auto-invite mode.
- Right-click the minimap button to open the addon settings.
- Use `/npi status` to check whether auto-invite mode is currently enabled.
- Enable a custom whisper in the addon options or set it with `/npi message <text>`. The message will be sent as `NearbyPartyInvite: <text>` after an invitation is sent unless the player is already in a group.
- In the addon settings, toggle whether scanning occurs on mouseover and target changes.
